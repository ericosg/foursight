## Concept Evolution

### Initial Idea (Rough Draft)
- **Character:** Ninja-like figure with extraordinary abilities.
- **Ability:** Can see all possible futures.
- **Gameplay:**  
  - Preplan moves by pressing buttons while the game is frozen.
  - Recorded button presses (with exact timing) are played back in sequence.
  - Any mistake triggers an instant restart.
- **Core Challenge:** Achieve a flawless execution where nothing goes wrong.

### Refined Concept: Foursight
- **Game Title:** **Foursight**
- **Premise:**  
  You control a being that exists in the fourth dimensionâ€”capable of perceiving and navigating time as easily as others move through space. With the power to process information across timelines, you can see all possible futures.
- **Core Gameplay Mechanics:**
  - **Preplanned Actions:**  
	The game begins in a frozen state, allowing you to record every move (with precise timing) by pressing controller buttons.
  - **Simulation:**  
	Once your sequence is finalized, the game plays out like a simulation, executing your moves in exact order.
  - **Instant Restart:**  
	A single error forces an immediate restart, demanding 100% precision and perfect foresight.
- **Player Experience:**  
  Instead of reacting in real-time, you orchestrate the perfect sequence of moves while time is frozen, then watch your carefully crafted plan unfold seamlessly.

## Core Mechanics

1. **Preplanning Phase:**
   - **Frozen Time:** The game starts with time halted.
   - **Input Recording:** Every button press, along with its timing, is meticulously recorded.
   
2. **Execution Phase:**
   - **Playback:** The recorded sequence is executed like a simulation.
   - **Failure Condition:** Any mistake triggers an instant restart, emphasizing the need for flawless execution.
   
3. **Precision & Strategy:**
   - **Challenge:** Master the art of prediction and perfect timing.
   - **Reward:** Each successful run is a testament to your strategic planning and precision.

## Design Vision & Future Considerations

- **Theme Integration:**  
  The concept aligns with the theme "Nothing can go wrong..." by ensuring that every detail, every move, must be perfect. This reinforces the game's challenge and the satisfaction of mastering its mechanics.

- **Foundation for Development:**  
  These core ideas will serve as the backbone for subsequent design elements such as enemy behavior, level design, and narrative integration.

- **Documentation:**  
  Keep detailed notes of brainstorming sessions and decision-making processes to refine and adjust the concept as needed.
