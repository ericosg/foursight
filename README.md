# Foursight
**Foursight** is a 2D platformer built in Godot and created for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025.1, inspired by the theme “Nothing can go wrong...”

## About
Step into the fourth dimension. In Foursight, you’re not just moving through space—you’re navigating time. With the unique ability to see all possible futures, you must plan every move before action begins.

## Gameplay
- **Pre-planning Phase:** The game starts in a frozen state where you record every button press along with its precise timing.
- **Execution:** Once your sequence is set, watch your strategy unfold in a seamless simulation.
- **Challenge:** Perfection is key. Every action must be exactly right for success.
