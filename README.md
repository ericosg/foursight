# Foursight
**Foursight** is a 2D platformer built in Godot and created for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025.1, inspired by the theme “Nothing can go wrong...”

## About
You see all possible futures. You only survive in one. You have to get it right—nothing can go wrong.

## Gameplay
- **Pre-planning Phase:** The game starts in a frozen state where you record every button press along with its precise timing.
- **Execution:** Once your sequence is set, watch your strategy unfold in a seamless simulation.
- **Challenge:** Perfection is key. Every action must be exactly right for success.
